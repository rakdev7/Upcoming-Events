/*

 The below algorithm uses binary search[O(logn)] and looping through all the elements[O(n)] in the `events` array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn).
 
 Assumptions - One assumption I've made is that when looking for conflicting events the first event in chronological order will be a `normal`(Not a conflict) event and the successive events that conflict with the before set `normal` event are marked as conflicts.
 
 Description - This algorithm takes an input array of EventModel items which are upcoming events from the mock.json file and sorts them in ascending order.

    let eventsCount = sortedEvents.count
