//Ideal place for the conflict checker algorithm.
func checkForConflicts() {
    
    /*
     The gist of the problem is to find meetings that are conflicting to each other and somehow indicate the conflicting events on the UI.
     
     My current solution has limitations and is not perfect and doesn't cover some edge cases.
     
     Need help in writing a new algorithm or refining my implementation to solve this problem. (I did find multiple implementations of this problem in Java but nothing in Swift so far.)
